# sg_update_ddns
Lambda to Update a security group on AWS with new DDNS IP address

Not the best written stuff, but works

Create security group, add IP address and use the DDNS as the description, will loop through rules until it gets a description if there will update to latest ddns, 
Can use the API or just Cloudwatch ever couple of hours
